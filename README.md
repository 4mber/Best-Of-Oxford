This is a "Best Of" map for Oxford, England! These are my favorite restaurants and coffee shops in Oxford.
It is fully responsive and works on all devices. Made possible through knockout.js, the Google Maps API and the Yelp API,
this app features a unique Google map including custom colors, a searchable list of locations, and custom markers including a link to the location's Yelp profile page,
each location's Yelp rating and top review (by [Yelp Sort criteria](https://www.quora.com/How-is-the-order-of-Yelp-Sort-determined).)

[Here's the demo!](https://4mber.github.io/Best-Of-Oxford/)
